== What is Facebook Page Spam Checker

== Where are the comments
I was recently told, "if your code needs to be commented, you're doing it wrong. Code should read". And I must say, I do agree.
I hope to add comments into this application after it's "done", this is so people can learn off of it. Anything that I do that
is a bit hacky, I will document it as I write it. I will also write a simplification of any long line. I use shorthand and 
long lines to keep code self-contained. Why write a block and clutter the page when you can use a single line? When doing
adjustments, it may be eaiser to break it into a block and then "recompile" it into a longline/shorthand again. But then the
code does not invade much space when working on other functions in that document.
