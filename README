== What is Facebook Page Spam Checker
Facebook page spam checker, besides being a mouthfull of a name, is a rails 3 application that uses Facebook's graph API to
grab statistics on a Facebook "page", which are generally used for products. The application aims to see how often they
produce items that will reach their users' walls and how well their users interact with said posts. Ideal usage is for a
Facebook owners to check if they are publishing too often and how well their publishings are being interacted with. Additional
use could be from Facebook users that want to check if a page will spam their feed or if the page is active.

== Where are the comments
I was recently told, "if your code needs to be commented, you're doing it wrong. Code should read". And I must say, I do agree.
I hope to add comments into this application after it's "done", this is so people can learn off of it. Anything that I do that
is a bit hacky, I will document it as I write it. I will also write a simplification of any long line. I use shorthand and 
long lines to keep code self-contained. Why write a block and clutter the page when you can use a single line? When doing
adjustments, it may be eaiser to break it into a block and then "recompile" it into a longline/shorthand again. But then the
code does not invade much space when working on other functions in that document.
